		<p>&quot;
		Jesus Christ, I believe you are the Son of God who came in the flesh, 
		you died and have resurrected and are the Lord. 
		Thank you for dying on the cross for my sins.&nbsp;
		I ask you in to my life and heart to be my Lord and Savior. 
	
		Please forgive my sins as i also ask you forgive everyone who has sinned against me,
		help me forgive, and by Your strength love others too from the heart even as You have loved me. 
		Help me to confess my sins and love You and others from the heart. 
		Help me to stop sinning, give my life totally to you 
		and fully trust and obey you, following Your example, and give me the gift of eternal life.&nbsp;
		
		I want to serve you always.&quot;</p>
